                Google turned 24 years of existence on September, 2022. The company has come a long way; from a search
                engine built in a garage to a massive, all-pervasive company, holding and giving us the answers and
                solutions to most of our queries. Today, most os uf see "Google" as a synonym for "Internet" and
                "search".
